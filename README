#   TensorFlow Learning
This repository is a set of Python projects (mixed .py scripts and .ipynb files) to help learn TensorFlow design patterns and features. The objective of this repository is to set up my knowledge base and experience to build machine learning applications using TensorFlow, and to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning best practices.

The core of the projects are the TensorFlow tutorial projects, as well as the 'exercises' included in the tutorials, which are extensions of the tutorial project with some additional complexity.

##  Dependencies
 - Python 3.x
 - [TensorFlow2](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
 - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
